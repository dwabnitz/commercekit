For anybody wanting to get started building D7 features (courtesy of the features module) or just setting up a commerce dev site quickly I whipped up a drush make file based on buildkit.

So, if you want to live on the edge and take latest drupalcommerce code for a spin just call

drush make "http://github.com/dwabnitz/commercekit/raw/master/distro.make" commercetest

Enjoy!
